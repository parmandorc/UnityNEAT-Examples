UnityNEAT
=========

UnityNEAT is a port of [SharpNEAT] from pure C# 4.0 to Unity 4.x and 5 (using Mono 2.6), and is integrated to work with Unity scenes for evaluation. UnityNEAT is created by Daniel Jallov as part of his [master's thesis] at the [Center for Computer Games Research] at the IT University in Copenhagen.

All the NEAT code is pure SharpNEAT, but is running in a single thread through Coroutines instead of using Parallel.For as in regular SharpNEAT.
